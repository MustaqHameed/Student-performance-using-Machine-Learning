Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict student performance based on various features such as study habits, attendance, and other related attributes. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and has been preprocessed to ensure accurate model training and evaluation.

Features of the Project
Dataset: Student performance data obtained from Kaggle.
Algorithms Used:
Polynomial Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Decision Tree Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were used to evaluate model performance.
Key Steps
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Model Training and Prediction:
Trained multiple machine learning models to predict student performance.
Compared the performance of each model.
Visualizations:
Scatter plots to compare actual vs. predicted values for each model.
Bar charts for error metric comparison.
Feature importance visualization for the Random Forest model.
Tree visualization for the Decision Tree model.
Results
Comprehensive analysis of model performances with detailed visualizations.
Insights into feature importance and their impact on student performance prediction.
