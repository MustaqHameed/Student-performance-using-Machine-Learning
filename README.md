# Student-performance-using-Machine-Learning

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict student performance based on various features such as study habits, attendance, and other related attributes. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and has been preprocessed to ensure accurate model training and evaluation.

# Features of the Project
Dataset: Student performance data obtained from Kaggle.
# Algorithms Used:
1)Polynomial Regression 

2)Random Forest Regressor

3)Decision Tree Regressor

4)XGBoost Regressor

* Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were used to evaluate model performance.
# Key Steps
1)Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

2)Model Training and Prediction:
Trained multiple machine learning models to predict student performance.
Compared the performance of each model.

3)Visualizations:
* Scatter plots to compare actual vs. predicted values for each model.
* Bar charts for error metric comparison.
* Feature importance visualization for the Random Forest model.

# Results
Comprehensive analysis of model performances with detailed visualizations.
Insights into feature importance and their impact on student performance prediction.
# How to Run
1)Clone the repository to your local machine.

2)Install the required Python libraries mentioned in requirements.txt.

3)Run the notebook or script file to train the models and generate visualizations.

# Project Goals
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in an educational context. The goal is to provide insights into factors influencing student performance and predict outcomes effectively
